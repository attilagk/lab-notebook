title: "Towards Precise Variant Calling"
---

Reference genome were prepared, sequencing reads were mapped for a single control individual, and SNVs and indels calling procedures were begun to be established.  Specifically, unfiltered and heuristically filtered MuTect2 and Strelka call sets are compared in this presentation.  Call sets with different reference tissues (NeuN- nuclei vs muscle) are also compared.
