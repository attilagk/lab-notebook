This progress report presents mostly two posts related to regression analysis.

## Post-presentation plans

### To do: inspect analyzed genes

* how were the 13 genes selected previously (by Ifat)?  In particular, PWAR6 was selected even though in [Figure 1][ifat-fig1] of Ifat's presentation it was classified as "novel 1 MB imprinted gene".
* extend regression analysis to all "novel 1 MB imprinted genes"
* location of analyzed imprinted genes with respect to imprinting clusters
* prior knowledge: GO and other knowledge bases
* prior knowledge: compare age effect to that seen by [Perez et al][perez] for the same genes

### Not to do: discarded plans

* regression-based classification of genes to correct for confounding variables (age, institution)
* hierarchical models
