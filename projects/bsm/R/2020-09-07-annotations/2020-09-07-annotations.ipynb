    "## Annotation with SNPnexus\n",
    "[SNPnexus](https://www.snp-nexus.org/v4/) is a recently updated web service that uses numerous databases to annotate human genomic variants (see [this article](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/W1/W185/5851388)).  The short sections below present information regarding the way I used SNPnexus to annotate our somatic variant calls.  The following settings were used:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Human Assembly: GRCh37/hg19\n",
    "* filtered VCF files were uploaded\n",
    "* all annotation categories were selected\n",
    "* *TXT per annotation*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overlapping genes\n",
    "A key annotation of *Overlapped and Nearest Genes*, stored in the `near_gens.txt` output file of SNPnexus.  Each variant is overlapped by zero, one or more genes. In the last case two or more genes overlap each other around the given variant and `near_gens.txt` lists the same variant in multiple rows corresponding to the multiple overlapping genes. Since my `calls` DataFrame must contain exactly one row for each variant I collapsed those multiple rows into one by listing the overlapping genes in a single colon (`:`) separated string.\n",
    "\n",
    "[This article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-49802-w) presents a study of overlapping genes and shows that sometimes more than 5 genes may overlap at a locus.  This means that for each variant I should come up with a---possibly empty---set of genes that overlap that variant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selecting sets of annotations\n",
    "\n",
    "See `notebook/2020-09-07-annotations/examine-annot-files.csv`, which lists all the annotation files and whether they were incuded in further analysis based on two criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "1. redundance: several sets annotations provide very similar information therefore only one of those were included\n",
    "2. relevance: cancer related annotations were excluded\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "See `SNPnexus.do_annot` for details"
