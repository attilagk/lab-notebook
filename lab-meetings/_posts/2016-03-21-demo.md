## Outline

Today we're going to

1. insert a new HTML post into the `Lab notebook`
1. learn basic and mathematical typesetting with $$\LaTeX$$
1. weave code chunks into prose and create dynamic documents
1. perform some analysis


## Inserting a new post

Almost done.  We can set hyperlinks to [a page on the Internet] or [a previous post] in our lab-notebook.
But we still need a convenient way of including a HTML generated from our dynamic `R Markdown` document.

{% include lab-meetings/2016-03-21-demo.html %}

[a page on the Internet]: http://jupyter.org
[a previous post]: {% post_url 2016-03-01-lab-notebook-sample-post %}
