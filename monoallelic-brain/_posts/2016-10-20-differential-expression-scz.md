title: Differentially Expressed Genes in Schizophrenia
---

## Introduction

This analysis compares some gene sets raised by our study to the set of differential expressed genes in schizophrenia (SCZ) presented by ([Fromer et al 2016](http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nn.4399.html)) in their article *Gene expression elucidates functional impact of polygenic risk for schizophrenia*.
