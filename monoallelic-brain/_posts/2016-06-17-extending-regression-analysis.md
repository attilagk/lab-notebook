The analysis presented here follows up on [earlier fitting of regression models]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /monoallelic-brain/2016-04-22-glm-for-s-statistic %}) on statistics (like $$S$$) based on read counts; somewhat less relevant the subsequent [comparison of regression models]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /monoallelic-brain/2016-05-07-comparing-regression-models %}).  Data processing steps as well as several notations and computational objects were introduced in [the article on data import]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /monoallelic-brain/2016-06-07-import-data %}).
