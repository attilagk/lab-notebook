title: Extending ANOVA
---

The analysis presented here follows up on the [previous ANOVA]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /monoallelic-brain/2016-04-22-glm-for-s-statistic %}) and extends it in two ways:

1. terms, corresponding to predictors, are added in various sequences
2. more genes (see the [preceding post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /monoallelic-brain/2016-06-17-extending-regression-analysis %}))

The present analysis has been extended several times over the time.  In particular, it depends on the model checking results presented in a subsequent post (see [Model Checking]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /monoallelic-brain/2016-09-23-model-checking %})).
