* finalize model selection; use *unlm.Q* family and fine-tune terms of linear predictor
* predict *Age*, *Ancestry.1*, *Gender* effect for each gene
* variance partitioning
    * try adapting `variancePartition` to complete model
    * consult with Gabriel
* conditional inference: institution
* checking p-value for the random effect of *Age*
    1. random permutations (suggested by Andy)
    1. profile likelihood
