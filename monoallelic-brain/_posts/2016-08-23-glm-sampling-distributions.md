## Introduction

This article illustrates some of the properties of the various regression models (logi.S, logi2.S, wnlm.S, wnlm.R, unlm.S, unlm.R) used to fit the Common Mind data as well as the properties of the data themselves

* link function: linear (wnlm.S, wnlm.R, unlm.S, unlm.R) and logit (logi.S, logi2.S)
* error distribution: normal (wnlm.S, wnlm.R, unlm.S, unlm.R) and binomial (logi.S, logi2.S)
* heteroscedasticity in data
